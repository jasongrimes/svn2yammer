SVN post-commit script to announce commits in a Yammer group.

To install, edit hooks/post-commit in the repository directory on your Subversion
server, and add the following:

-------------- Sample hooks/post-commit file ----------------------

REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"

/usr/bin/php /path/to/svn2yammer.php $REPOS $REV

-------------- End sample hooks/post-commit file ------------------

See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.reposhooks.post-commit.html for
information about adding Subversion post-commit hooks.
